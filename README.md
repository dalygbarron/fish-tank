Every browser based game library sucks real bad real good UNTIL NOW... Wahooo,
we now have fish-tank; a browser based game library that takes loose
inspiration from lua love since it's real nice but not browser based obviously.

We have:
 - Not much state.
 - Nice interfaces for default subsystems
 - you can rewrite any subsystem you want as long as you implement a small
   interface.
 - gui system.
 - batched sprite rendering on gpu.
