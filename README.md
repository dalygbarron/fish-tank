Every browser based game library sucks real bad real good UNTIL NOW... Wahooo,
we now have fish-tank; a browser based game library that takes loose
inspiration from lua love since it's real nice but not browser based obviously.

I guess another way of describing this library is that it's everything I ended
up implementing on top of other libraries implemented beforehand. The
interfaces are designed to be easy to use and not require reams of code, so
that you can make games quickly and with good code quality. For some reason or
other the web seems to hate both of those things.

Admittedly, if you want maximum control, you might find the way this engine's
interfaces work a little bit too friendly for your liking. All I can say is
enjoy writing your own engine because I don't care.

I just converted this thing from javascript to typescript and also modified it
a lot and removed some things and improved some things etc so I have as of yet
not rewritten the documentation that was here.
