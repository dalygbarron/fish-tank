Stuff to do before releasing the typescript version:
 - reimplement gamepad support
 - Get rid of the broken shit folder.
 - make webpack stop mentioning that there is no prod build or whatever and
   generally make webpack work nice.

Stuff to do before releasing a later typescript version:
 - think about implementation transformed sprites in the sprite batch. I just
   read that it is faster to do this via the CPU than on the GPU and that you
   can indeed just use a single vector to represent both uniform scaling and
   rotation.
