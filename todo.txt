Stuff to do before releasing the typescript version:
 - Add default settings for texture sampling and also make it that your only
   choices are linear or nearest, and wrapping wise it's full wrap or full
   clamp and you don't need to screw with gl constants.
 - Figure out where to put default values for gl blend mode and that sort of
   stuff. I guess ideally you should be able to customise these but on the other
   hand I really don't care and highly doubt anybody else does so might be a
   waste of time.
 - Shouldn't need to use WebGLRenderingContext and AudioContext in user code
   really at all. Find the last few usages and eradicate them. (passing it to
   stuff doesn't count and the user can use them if they want anyway).


Stuff to do before releasing a later typescript version:
 - think about implementation transformed sprites in the sprite batch. I just
   read that it is faster to do this via the CPU than on the GPU and that you
   can indeed just use a single vector to represent both uniform scaling and
   rotation.

Stuff that is DONE!!!!!
 - reimplement gamepad support
 - Get rid of the broken shit folder.
 - make webpack stop mentioning that there is no prod build or whatever and
   generally make webpack work nice.
